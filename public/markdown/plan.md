* [**The Wall Street Journal**](http//:wsj.com) Lead effort to increase quality of web fonts for WSJ.com by securing a spot for beta-testing Hoefler & Co's new Cloud.typography service.  The ScreenSmart technology proved that font foundries can, with care, engineer their fonts to raster high-quality type for the web.  These tests resulted in my negotiating a self-hosted webfont license with Hoefler & Co. for the Dow Jones/Wall Street Journal web properties. Implemented a centralized webfont serving solution that leverages GitHub, Nodejs, Amazon AWS, and Akamai caching to provide fast and performative delivery of our webfonts to our readers and ensure our organization follows the boundries of the license agreement.
