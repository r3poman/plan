##Current and recent-past works and ruminations.

* [**Dow Jones & Co.**](http://dj.com) Integrated Team Director working with editoral, product, ux, design, and technology for the WSJ.com Redesign project currently in-flight.  Leveraging [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/), [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org), [NewRelic](http://newrelic.com), [Backbonejs](http://backbonejs.org), [Angularjs](https://angularjs.org), among other technologies. Team Lead for the architectural organization and personnel responsibilities of our WSJ.com GitHub code bases and consultant for new deployment systems using AWS load-balancing to improve the flexibility of, and pipeline to, our QA and production environments.  Leading effort of an API service to be consumed by the front-end for market data points coordinated with editoral to insure parity across the Wall Street Journal Digital Network.            

* [**Dow Jones & Co.**](http://dj.com) Head of the Consumer Technology R&D User-Experience Development Group, an integrated design, ux, and front-end technology team at [Wall Street Journal](http://wsj.com), working with the Dow Jones R&D, focused on building communications and Amazon Web cloud-based collaboration technology. Key points included **DJHub**, web-based IM/Video chat application powered by [ejabberd](http://www.ejabberd.im) (server), [strophejs](https://github.com/strophe/strophejs) (XMPP client) and the [Backbonejs](http://backbonejs.org) front-end framework; and **Briefcase**, a cloud-based document collaboration environment powered by [Crocodoc](https://crocodoc.com) (now owned by Box.com).  Promoted and evangelized the importance of branded-interaction models, the ability to communicate emotion within textual communication environments, better HTML DOM structures within our Hogan templates to increase the flexiblity of the front-end UI, and how identity relates to and engages the end user. Researched and prototyped a streams-based, breaking-news iOS application, better exposing user-generated content, that also offered an alternative to traditional commenting systems.  

* [**Dow Jones & Co.**](http://dj.com) Led the initiative to increase quality of web fonts for WSJ.com by securing a spot beta-testing [Hoefler & Co's](http://www.typography.com) new [Cloud.typography](http://www.typography.com/cloud/welcome/) service. These tests resulted in my negotiating a [self-hosted webfont license with Hoefler & Co. for the Dow Jones/Wall Street Journal web properties](http://www.typography.com/blog/thank-you). Implemented a centralized webfont serving solution that leverages [GitHub](http://github.com), [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/), [Amazon AWS](http://aws.amazon.com), and [Akamai](http://www.akamai.com) caching to provide fast and performative delivery of our webfonts to our readers and ensure our organization follows the boundries of the license agreement.

* [**Dow Jones & Co.**](http://dj.com) Team Director of the Dow Jones [Lightboard](http://betaweb.dowjones.com/db/lightboard/), a project with Cooper Union interns to explore interaction models for large-scale indoor environmental graphics using a [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)-based web application and an iOS/Objective-C application connected via [WebSockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Websocket), [iBeacons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon) for iOS notificaitons and proximity sensing, and the [Dow Jones LED walls](https://segd.org/dow-joneswall-street-journal-headquarters-environmental-graphics) in the NYC office to provide an informational and *gamified* experience that provides useful information on [@wsj](https://twitter.com/WSJ) story content as well as engaging the viewer through interaction when the user is in the proximity of the LED display screen. The project was invited to and particpated in the 2014 [NYC Media Lab Annual Summit](http://www.nycmedialab.org/annual-summit/) in September.

* "Our conventional response to all media, namely that it is how they are used that counts, is the numb stance of the technological idiot. For the "content" of a medium is like the juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind. The effect of the medium is made strong and intense just because it is given another medium as "content." The content of a movie is a novel or a play or an opera. The effect of the movie form is not related to its program content. The "content" of writing or print is speech, but the reader is almost entirely unaware either of print or of speech ... The effects of technology do not occur at the level of opinions or concepts, but alter sense ratios or patterns of perception steadily and without any resistance. The serious artist is the only person able to encounter technology with impunity, just because he(†) is an expert aware of the changes in sense perception."
**--McLuhan**

* (†)McLuhan always spoke in the masculine - man, him, and he. But for our time it should be inclusive of *feminine* - human, woman, her, and she.  Just thought I'd put that out there...
