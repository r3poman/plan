##Current and recent-past works and ruminations.

* [**The Wall Street Journal**](http//:wsj.com) Integrated Team Lead working with editoral, product, ux, design, and technology for the WSJ.com Redesign project currently in-flight.  Leveraging [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/), [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org), [NewRelic](http://newrelic.com), [Backbonejs](http://backbonejs.org), [Angularjs](https://angularjs.org), among other technologies. Team Lead for archetectual organization and responsibilities of our WSJ.com git code bases and consultant for our new deployment system using AWS load-balancing for improving the flexibility of and pipeline to our QA and production environments.         

* [**The Wall Street Journal**](http//:wsj.com) Head of the Consumer Technology R&D User-Experience Development group, an integrated design, ux, and front-end technology team at [Wall Street Journal](http://wsj.com), working with the Dow Jones R&D, focused on building communications and Amazon Web cloud-based collaboration technology. Key points included **DJHub**, web-based IM/Video chat application powered by [ejabberd](http://www.ejabberd.im) (server), [strophejs](https://github.com/strophe/strophejs) (XMPP client) and the [Backbonejs](http://backbonejs.org) front-end framework; and **Briefcase**, a cloud-based document collaboration environment powered by [Crocodoc](https://crocodoc.com) (now owned by Box.com).  Promoted and evangelized the importance of branded-interaction models, the ability to communicate emotion within textual communication environments, better HTML DOM structures within our Hogan templates to increase the flexiblity of the front-end UI, and how identity relates to and engages the end user. Researched and prototyped a streams-based, breaking-news iOS application, better exposing user-generated content, that also offered an alternative to traditional commenting systems.  

* [**The Wall Street Journal**](http//:wsj.com) Lead effort to increase quality of web fonts for WSJ.com by securing a spot for beta-testing [Hoefler & Co's](http://www.typography.com) new [Cloud.typography](http://www.typography.com/cloud/welcome/) service.  The [ScreenSmart](http://www.typography.com/cloud/the-fonts/) technology proved that font foundries can, with care, engineer their fonts to raster high-quality type for the web.  These tests resulted in my negotiating a [self-hosted webfont license with Hoefler & Co. for the Dow Jones/Wall Street Journal web properties](http://www.typography.com/blog/thank-you). Implemented a centralized webfont serving solution that leverages [GitHub](http://github.com), [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/), [Amazon AWS](http://aws.amazon.com), and [Akamai](http://www.akamai.com) caching to provide fast and performative delivery of our webfonts to our readers and ensure our organization follows the boundries of the license agreement.
